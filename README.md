# Operation-Sharpshooter
Fastest Hands in the West!!!
The idea is to create a game of speed. The objective, react faster than your opponent or you're dead. Using code, similar to the one we used in class to log every time we pushed the button, our breadboard will have two buttons. The light with illuminate, once it shuts off the first to press their button will survive. This is similar to the wild west, quickest draw means you live. Our code will be random and ever changing making it unpredictable and a constant challenge.
